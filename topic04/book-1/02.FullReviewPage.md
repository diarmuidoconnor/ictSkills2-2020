## Full Review Page.

Each review extract on the Movie Details page has a link to display a new page that shows the full text of the review. 

Create the file `src/components/movieReview/index.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";

export default ({ review }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Review By: {review.author} </p>
      <p>{review.content} </p>
    </>
  );
};
~~~

Create the file `src/pages/movieReviewPage.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import PageTemplate from '../components/templateMoviePage'
import MovieReview from "../components/movieReview";

const MovieReviewPage = (props) => {
  return (
      <PageTemplate movie={props.location.state.movie}>
        <MovieReview review={props.location.state.review} /> 
      </PageTemplate>
  );
};

export default MovieReviewPage;
~~~
The above page is rendered when the user clicks a review excerpt link on the movie details page. That link included two objects (movie and review), which are made available to the page through the *location* prop (props.location.state). Also, component composition occurs above between the template and the MovieReview components.

The final step is to add a new route for this page to `src/indecx.js`, as follows:

+ an an import at the top:
~~~
import MovieReviewPage from "./pages/movieReviewPage";
~~~
+ Add a route:
~~~
<Switch>
    <Route path="/reviews/:id" component={MovieReviewPage} />
    . . . other routes . . .
</Switch>
~~~

In the browser:

1. Go to the home page and click a movie.
1. In the movie details page click Show Reviews and click the 'Full Review' link of one of the review excerpts.
