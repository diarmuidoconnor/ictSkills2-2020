## Refactoring.

The list of favorite movies are currently managed by a custom class, StubAPI. A better solution would be to integrate them into the movies context. This context's state will now consist of two arrays:

+ movies - the list of movies displayed on the home page.
+ favorites - list of movies displayed on the Favorites page.

We could model this as two separate state variables, however the useReducer hook would allow us combine them and also make it easier to manipulate them, i.e. moving a movie from one list to the other.

In `src/contexts/movieContext.js` replace the entire code with the following:

~~~
import React, { useEffect, createContext, useReducer } from "react";
import { getMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = createContext(null);

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "add-favorite":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.filter((m) => m.id !== action.payload.movie.id),
        favorites: [...state.favorites, action.payload.movie],
      };
    case "load-movies":
      return { movies: [...action.payload.movies], favorites: [] };
    case "add-review":
      // Completed in next section
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { movies: [], favorites: [] });

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const index = state.movies.map((m) => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
    dispatch({ type: "add-favorite", payload: { movie: state.movies[index] } });
  };

  const addReview = () => {
      // Completed in next section
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load-movies", payload: { movies } });
    });
  }, []);
  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: state.movies,
        favorites: state.favorites,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites,
        addReview: addReview,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
~~~
Some points to note:

+ useReducer takes two arguments:
   + The initial value for the state object, i.e.
{ movies: [], favorites: [] }

    + a function that manages the mutation of the state object - reducer (arbitrary name).

+ useReducer returns a reference to the state object and a function to send/dispatch requests to the reducer function - requests to mutate the state.
+ The dispatch function signature includes the name of a mutation action (what state change it want to perform) and the payload/data associated with the action. Two action types are currently supported: add-favorite and load-movies.
+ Internally the dispatcher invokes the reducer function passing it the current state object reference and the mutation action details.
+ The reducer function performs a state update based on the action type and associated payload it receives. NOTE, it does not change the state object, it makes a copy of it, changes the copy and returns the copy. The copy replaces the previous state object. The useReducer hook mandates this approach to state mutation.

In `pages/favoriteMoviesPage.js` replace the entire content with the following:

~~~
import React, {useContext} from "react";
import MovieListPageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import AddReviewButton from '../components/buttons/addReview'
import {MoviesContext} from '../contexts/moviesContext'
 
const FavoriteMoviesPage = props => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
  return (
    <MovieListPageTemplate
      movies={context.favorites}
      title={"Favorite Movies"}
      action={movie => <AddReviewButton movie={movie} />}
    />
  );
};

export default FavoriteMoviesPage;
~~~

The only change above is we switched from using the stub API to the movies context.

Check the add favorites feature works.

Update the project git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor add favorites feature"
