## Assembling the Movie Details page.

To bring the components from the previous section together, create the file `src/pages/movieDetailsPage.js` and paste in this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import MovieHeader from "../components/headerMovie";
import MovieDetails from "../components/movieDetails";
import "./moviePage.css";

const MoviePage = ({ movie }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {movie ? (
        <>
          <MovieHeader movie={movie} />
          <div className="row">
            <div className="col-3">
              <img
                src={
                  movie.poster_path
                    ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${movie.poster_path}`
                    : "./film-poster-placeholder.png"
                }
                className="movie"
                alt={movie.title}
              />
            </div>
            <div className="col-9">
              <MovieDetails movie={movie} />
            </div>
          </div>
        </>
        ) : (
        <p>Waiting for movie details</p>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default MoviePage;
~~~
Currently this page component expects to receive a movie object as a prop. In a future lab it will request the movie directly from the open API. As a consequence the page may render before the response is received, resulting in an undefined movie object reference and the app crashing. In the above code note we use the ternary operator to check the movie object's status and render a placeholder text, 'Waiting for movie details', when it is false (undefined).  

Create the file `src/pages/moviePage.css`:
~~~
img.movie {
   float: left; 
   width: 100%;
   height: 90%;
}
~~~

As a temporary solution we will statically connect this page to the app's top component - App. In `src/index.js` add an import statement at the top:
~~~
import MoviePage from './pages/moviePage'
~~~
and change the App component as follows:
~~~
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="jumbotron">
      <MoviePage movie={sample} />
    </div>
  );
};
~~~

Start the development server:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~

The browser should render the Movie Details page:

![][moviepage]

From the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository, as follows:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Movie Details Page rendering"
~~~

[moviepage]: ./img/moviepage.png
